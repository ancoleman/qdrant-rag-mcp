# Strategic Analysis Features Release Plan (v0.6.x+)

## Executive Summary

This release plan introduces **Strategic Analysis** capabilities - a new layer of intelligence that synthesizes insights from multiple sources to support feature planning and technical decision-making. Unlike tactical bug fixes, this focuses on strategic project direction while maintaining extreme token efficiency.

## Core Design Principles

### 1. **Token Efficiency First**
- Pre-computed metrics stored outside conversation
- Hierarchical summaries (500 → 2000 → detailed tokens)
- Background processing for expensive computations
- Cache everything reusable

### 2. **Analytics, Not Search**
- Move from "finding code" to "understanding patterns"
- Aggregate insights, not raw data
- Strategic recommendations, not tactical fixes

### 3. **Progressive Disclosure**
- Start with high-level insights
- Drill down only when needed
- User controls token consumption

## Release Timeline

## Conclusion

This strategic analysis layer transforms our RAG server from a "code finder" to a "project intelligence system" while maintaining extreme token efficiency. By pre-computing analytics and using progressive disclosure, we enable strategic planning without burning through context windows.

The key innovation is moving expensive computation outside the conversation, storing insights not data, and giving users exactly the level of detail they need for decision-making.
