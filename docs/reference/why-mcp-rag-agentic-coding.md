## The Token Problem in AI Coding

When AI agents like Claude work with codebases, they face a fundamental challenge: **context window limitations and token costs**.

### Traditional Approach Problems

Without intelligent context retrieval, AI agents must:
- Process entire files to find relevant code (5,000+ tokens per file)
- Search through multiple files manually (50,000+ tokens for small projects)
- Re-read files repeatedly for different tasks
- Waste tokens on irrelevant content
- Hit context limits on medium-sized projects

### The Mathematics of Inefficiency

Consider a simple task: "Fix the authentication bug in the login flow"

**Without RAG**:
```
10 relevant files × 1,000 lines each × 5 tokens/line = 50,000 tokens
+ Multiple searches through content = 100,000+ tokens
+ Re-reading for different aspects = 200,000+ tokens total
```

**Result**: Expensive, slow, and often hitting context limits.

## How MCP Changes Everything

Model Context Protocol (MCP) creates a separation between:
- **Token-consuming operations** (what the AI sees)
- **Computational operations** (what happens server-side)

### The Key Architecture

     └── Sees only results ──┘                  └── Does all computation
         (costs tokens)                             (zero token cost)
```

### What Happens in an MCP Call

When Claude calls `search_code("authentication bug")`:

1. **Request** (20 tokens):
   ```json
   {
     "method": "search_code",
     "params": {"query": "authentication bug", "n_results": 5}
   }
   ```

2. **Server-Side Processing** (0 tokens to Claude):
   - Generates embeddings using local model
   - Searches through thousands of code chunks in Qdrant
   - Applies hybrid search algorithms
   - Ranks results by relevance
   - Expands context around matches
   - Filters by confidence threshold

3. **Response** (500-1000 tokens):
   ```json
   {
     "results": [
       {
         "file": "auth/login.py",
         "line": 45-67,
         "content": "[relevant code snippet]",
         "score": 0.92
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

## The Architecture of Efficiency

### 1. Local Computation Layer

All heavy processing happens on your machine:

```python
# What happens server-side (0 tokens to Claude):
def search_code(query, n_results=5):
    # Generate embeddings locally
    embeddings = sentence_transformer.encode(query)
    
    # Search vector database locally
    vector_results = qdrant_client.search(
        collection="code",
        query_vector=embeddings,
        limit=100  # Get many candidates
    )
    
    # Apply BM25 keyword search locally
    keyword_results = bm25_index.search(query)
    
    # Merge and rank results locally
    combined = hybrid_ranker.combine(vector_results, keyword_results)
    
    # Expand context locally
    with_context = add_surrounding_code(combined)
    
    # Return only top results
    return with_context[:n_results]
```

### 2. Progressive Information Retrieval

Claude can efficiently drill down into code:

```python
# Step 1: Broad search (costs ~1000 tokens)
results = search_code("performance issue", n_results=10)

# Step 2: Focused search (costs ~500 tokens)
specific = search_code("search function slow cache", n_results=5)

# Step 3: Get full context (costs ~300 tokens)
full_function = get_file_chunks("src/search.py", start=45, end=50)

# Total: 1,800 tokens vs 50,000+ tokens without MCP
```

### 3. Intelligent Caching and Context

The RAG server maintains:
- **Project awareness**: Knows which project you're working on
- **Indexed knowledge**: Pre-processed understanding of your codebase
- **Dependency graphs**: Understands code relationships
- **Change detection**: Only reindexes modified files

## Real-World Impact

### Example 1: Bug Fixing

**Task**: Fix a complex bug across multiple files

**Without MCP RAG**:
- Load 20 files: 100,000 tokens
- Search through them: Burning context window
- Often fail due to context limits

**With MCP RAG**:
- Search for error: 1,000 tokens
- Find related code: 1,500 tokens
- Get specific files: 2,000 tokens
- Total: 4,500 tokens (95% reduction)

### Example 2: Feature Implementation

**Task**: Add authentication to an API endpoint

**Without MCP RAG**:
- Find all auth code: 50,000 tokens
- Find API patterns: 30,000 tokens
- Find tests: 20,000 tokens
- Total: 100,000 tokens

**With MCP RAG**:
- Search auth patterns: 1,000 tokens
- Find similar endpoints: 1,000 tokens
- Get test examples: 1,000 tokens
- Total: 3,000 tokens (97% reduction)

### Example 3: GitHub Issue Resolution

**Task**: Analyze and fix GitHub issue #123

**Without optimization**:
- 16 searches × 10 results each: 15,000 tokens

**With optimization**:
- Summarized results: 500 tokens (97% reduction)

## Why This Matters for Agentic Coding
