- Regex-based extraction of headings, code blocks, links, and frontmatter
- Section chunking creates natural document boundaries
- Metadata tracks heading hierarchy for contextual understanding
- Large sections split at paragraph boundaries with overlap
- Summary extraction for quick document previews
- Integrated with `server_config.json` for configurable chunk sizes and ranking weights
- Documentation-specific ranking weights optimize for recency and relevance

### Migration Guide
Documentation files are now indexed automatically when using `index_directory`. 
For existing projects, reindex to include documentation:
```
"Reindex this directory to include documentation"
```

## [0.2.2] - 2025-05-29

### Critical Fix
- **Fixed Critical Working Directory Bug**: MCP server now correctly handles client working directory
  - Server was using its own working directory instead of client's actual location
  - Caused wrong project to be indexed when using relative paths or "." directory
  - Example: Running `index_directory(".")` from `/panflow` indexed `/qdrant-rag` instead

### Fixed  
- **Fixed Missing `.ragignore` Support**: The `.ragignore` file now actually works
  - Previously, `.ragignore` file existed but was not being read or used
  - Exclusion patterns were hardcoded instead of reading from file
  - Now properly loads and applies patterns from `.ragignore`

### Added
- **Natural Language Working Directory Setup**: Users can now set working directory using natural language
  - No configuration required - works immediately
  - Example: "Get pwd, export MCP_CLIENT_CWD to that value, then run health check"
  - Provides the easiest way to ensure correct project context
- **MCP_CLIENT_CWD Environment Variable**: New environment variable to pass client's working directory
  - Allows MCP server to know the actual directory where user is working
  - Set this in your environment or .env file for accurate project detection
  - Can be set dynamically via natural language commands
- **Client Directory Parameter**: `get_current_project()` now accepts optional `client_directory` parameter
  - Used internally by `index_directory` to ensure correct project context
- **Command Line Argument**: Added `--client-cwd` argument for setting client working directory
  - Allows configuration via Claude Code's args array
  - Overrides MCP_CLIENT_CWD environment variable when provided
- **Improved Directory Validation**: Better error messages and validation for directory parameters
  - Now requires explicit directory parameter (no default to ".")
  - Clear warnings when server's working directory is used as fallback
- **Claude Code Configuration Guide**: Comprehensive documentation for working directory setup
  - Created docs/claude-code-config-example.md
  - Shows multiple configuration options including natural language approach
- **`.ragignore` File Support**: Now properly reads and uses `.ragignore` file for exclusion patterns
  - Searches for `.ragignore` in project directory and parent directories
  - Supports glob patterns (e.g., `*.pyc`, `.env*`, `node_modules/`)
  - Falls back to sensible defaults if no `.ragignore` found
  - Replaces hardcoded exclusion patterns with configurable ones

### Changed
- **index_directory() Signature**: Changed from `directory="."` to `directory=None` (now required)
  - Prevents accidental indexing of wrong directory
  - Forces users to be explicit about which directory to index
- **Enhanced Logging**: Added detailed logging for working directory resolution
  - Shows when client directory is detected from environment
  - Warns when falling back to server's working directory
- **Better Error Messages**: More descriptive errors with error codes
  - `MISSING_DIRECTORY`: When directory parameter is not provided
  - Includes helpful suggestions for resolution
- **health_check() Enhancement**: Now uses MCP_CLIENT_CWD for accurate project detection
  - Shows client_cwd field when environment variable is set
- **get_context() Enhancement**: Now uses MCP_CLIENT_CWD for accurate project context
  - Ensures project statistics reflect the correct working directory

### Technical Details
- Implemented three-tier directory resolution:
  1. MCP protocol context (placeholder for future MCP support)
  2. Environment variable `MCP_CLIENT_CWD`
  3. Fallback to server's `Path.cwd()` with warning
- Updated `.env` and `.env.example` with new configuration option
- Added `--client-cwd` command-line argument support
- Enhanced `health_check()` and `get_context()` to use client working directory
- Implemented `load_ragignore_patterns()` function to parse `.ragignore` files
- Updated `index_directory()` to use dynamic patterns instead of hardcoded ones
- Added `fnmatch` support for proper glob pattern matching
- Maintains backward compatibility while encouraging safer usage patterns

### Migration Guide
For users upgrading from v0.2.1:

1. **Easiest Option - Natural Language** (no configuration needed):
   ```
   "Get pwd, export MCP_CLIENT_CWD to that value, then run health check"
   ```

2. **Configuration Option** - Update Claude Code config:
   ```json
   "env": {"MCP_CLIENT_CWD": "${workspaceFolder}"}
   ```

3. **Code Changes**:
   - Update `index_directory` calls to include explicit paths
   - Use absolute paths for most reliable operation

## [0.2.1] - 2025-05-28

### Added
- **Enhanced Ranking Signals**: Multi-signal ranking system for improved search precision
  - File proximity scoring: Boosts results from same/nearby directories
  - Dependency distance ranking: Prioritizes direct imports/dependencies
  - Code structure similarity: Groups similar code structures (functions, classes)
  - Recency weighting: Favors recently modified files
- **Configurable Ranking Weights**: Customize signal importance via `config/server_config.json`
- **Modified timestamp tracking**: Files now store modification time for recency scoring

### Improvements
- Search results now use enhanced ranking combining 5 signals for better relevance
- Ranking weights are configurable and normalized automatically

  - New `context_chunks` parameter (default: 1, max: 3) controls context expansion
  - New `get_file_chunks` tool for retrieving complete file context
  - Expanded search results show context before/after matched sections
  - Clear section markers in expanded content ("Context Before", "Matched Section", "Context After")

### Changed
- **Increased Default Chunk Sizes** for better context capture:
  - Code chunks: 1500 → 3000 characters (2x increase)
  - Code chunk overlap: 300 → 600 characters
  - Config chunks: 1000 → 2000 characters
  - Config chunk overlap: 200 → 400 characters
- Search results now include `expanded_content`, `has_context`, and `total_line_range` fields
- Content truncation added to prevent token limit errors (1500 chars for content, 2000 for expanded_content)

### Fixed
- Fixed missing logger in `_expand_search_context` function
- Added content truncation to prevent MCP token limit errors (25k tokens)
- Default `n_results` kept at 5 to avoid token limits with larger chunks

### Technical Details
- Implemented `_expand_search_context` method for intelligent context expansion
- Context expansion fetches adjacent chunks from Qdrant efficiently
- Maintains backward compatibility with optional parameters
- Reduces need for follow-up file reads by 50-70%

### Documentation

## [0.1.9] - 2025-05-27

### Added
- **Dependency-Aware Search** - First phase of Advanced Hybrid Search implementation

- Dependency graph builder that extracts import/export relationships from AST data
- Automatic inclusion of files that import or are imported by search results
- Dependency tracking across the entire codebase with bidirectional relationships
- Related files are included with reduced scores (0.7x) to maintain relevance

### Technical Details
- `DependencyGraphBuilder` class manages import/export relationships
- Integrates with existing AST chunking to extract dependency metadata
- Stores import information (module names, imported symbols) in chunk metadata
- Builds reverse dependency mappings (which files import a given file)
- Supports relative and absolute imports with path resolution
- Performance optimized with lazy loading and caching

### Changed
- Code indexer now extracts and stores dependency information
- Search results can include dependent files when `include_dependencies=True`
- Improved code understanding by showing related files in search results
- Fixed import statement to use relative imports with fallback

### Known Issues
- When `include_dependencies=true`, dependency files may dominate search results if they contain 
  the exact search terms (e.g., searching for "module_name imports" will rank files that import 
  that module higher than the module's implementation)
- This is technically correct behavior but may not match user expectations
- Will be addressed in v0.2.0 with smart reranking and query understanding features
