# Progressive Context Management Documentation (v0.3.2)

This directory contains all documentation related to the Progressive Context Management feature scheduled for v0.3.2.

## Overview

Progressive Context Management will deliver 50-70% token reduction for initial queries by implementing a multi-level context API that provides file → class → method hierarchy with semantic caching.

## Documentation Files

### 1. [Implementation Plan](./progressive-context-implementation-plan.md)
The main implementation plan covering:
- Architecture and core components
- Context levels (file, class, method)
- Query intent classification
- Semantic caching strategy
- Implementation phases and timeline

### 2. [Integration Strategy](./progressive-context-integration-strategy.md)
Strategic decision to enhance existing search tools rather than create new ones:
- Why integration is better than separate tools
- Backward compatibility approach
- Feature flag strategy
- Migration path

### 3. [Code Structure](./progressive-context-code-structure.md)
Detailed code organization showing:
- New files to be created
- Modifications to existing files
- Integration points with other features
- Testing structure

## Key Features

- **50-70% token reduction** for high-level queries
- **Multi-level context API**: file → class → method hierarchy
- **Semantic caching** for query similarity matching
- **Query intent classification** for automatic level selection
- **Progressive expansion** allowing drill-down into details
- **Backward compatible** with existing search tools

## Integration Approach

Rather than creating new MCP tools, we'll enhance existing ones:
- `search()` - General search with progressive context
- `search_code()` - Code search with hierarchy support
- `search_docs()` - Documentation search with section levels

New parameters:
- `context_level`: "auto", "file", "class", "method", "full"
- `progressive_mode`: Enable/disable progressive features
- `include_expansion_options`: Show drill-down options
- `semantic_cache`: Use similarity-based caching

## Timeline

- **Days 1-3**: Core infrastructure
- **Days 4-6**: Semantic caching
- **Days 7-8**: Query intelligence
- **Days 9-10**: Integration & testing

Total: ~1.5 weeks

## Success Metrics

- 50-70% token reduction for high-level queries
- 40% cache hit rate
- 80% feature adoption
- No degradation in search quality
