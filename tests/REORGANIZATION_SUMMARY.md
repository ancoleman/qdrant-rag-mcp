# Test Reorganization Summary

## What Changed

The tests directory has been reorganized from a flat structure to a categorized structure for better maintainability and clarity.

### Before
```
tests/
├── test_*.py (56 files mixed together)
├── debug_*.py
├── reindex-test/
└── *.md
```

### After
```
tests/
├── unit/           # Fast, isolated component tests
├── integration/    # Multi-component integration tests
├── performance/    # Performance and memory tests
├── debug/          # Debugging scripts (not pytest tests)
├── examples/       # Test data and validation guides
│   ├── test_projects/     # Sample projects
│   └── validation_guides/ # Manual testing guides
├── conftest.py     # Pytest configuration and fixtures
└── README.md       # Documentation
```

## Benefits

1. **Clear Organization** - Easy to find specific types of tests
2. **Faster Development** - Run only unit tests during development
3. **Better CI/CD** - Can run different test suites in different stages
4. **Separation of Concerns** - Debug scripts separate from actual tests
5. **Reusable Fixtures** - Common test fixtures in conftest.py

## New Features

### Test Runner Script (`run_tests.sh`)
```bash
./run_tests.sh unit        # Run unit tests
./run_tests.sh integration # Run integration tests
./run_tests.sh coverage    # Run with coverage report
./run_tests.sh quick       # Run fast tests only
```

### Pytest Configuration (`pytest.ini`)
- Test discovery patterns
- Test markers (unit, integration, slow, etc.)
- Coverage configuration

### Common Fixtures (`conftest.py`)
- `temp_test_dir` - Temporary directory for tests
- `sample_python_file` - Sample Python file
- `sample_config_file` - Sample JSON config
- `sample_markdown_file` - Sample markdown file

## Migration Notes

- All existing tests preserved and moved to appropriate categories
- No test functionality changed, only organization
- Import paths in tests remain the same (src added to path in conftest.py)
- Debug scripts remain standalone Python scripts

## Future Improvements

1. Add more test markers for better filtering
2. Create more reusable fixtures
3. Add performance benchmarks
4. Integrate with CI/CD pipelines
5. Add test coverage badges to README
