## How to Use These Templates

1. **Copy the template** - Don't edit the templates directly
2. **Customize for your project** - Replace placeholder text with your specific information
3. **Remove unnecessary sections** - Not every section will apply to every project
4. **Add project-specific sections** - Extend templates as needed
5. **Keep templates updated** - As you learn, improve the templates for future use

## Template Principles

These templates follow several key principles:

- **Comprehensive but flexible** - Cover all bases but easy to customize
- **Metric-driven** - Include measurable success criteria
- **Risk-aware** - Always consider what could go wrong
- **Team-oriented** - Clear ownership and responsibilities
- **Progress-focused** - Easy to track status at a glance
- **Reusable** - Generic enough to apply to various projects

## Contributing

If you develop improvements to these templates or create new ones:

1. Ensure they're generic enough for reuse
2. Include clear "when to use" guidance
3. Add examples where helpful
4. Keep formatting consistent
5. Update this README
